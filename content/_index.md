Hello! I'm **Om Arora**, a researcher and developer based in Delhi, India. 

I am interested in **theoretical physics, mathematics, AI, and quantitative finance**, with a deep interest in **astronomy, philosophy, history, and algorithm design**. My work bridges foundational research—like extensions to Yang–Mills theory and quantum gravity—with applied systems in machine learning, IoT, and algorithmic trading.

Currently, I’m contributing to AI for Mathematical Olympiads, developing models that solve IMO-level proofs, while also building quantitative strategies under NDA. I enjoy turning abstract principles into functional tools—whether through sensor-based health devices, persistent homology in finance, or spacetime emergence models.

I’m driven by a long-term vision: to weave rigorous research, quantitative insight, and entrepreneurial execution into ventures that solve complex, real-world challenges.
