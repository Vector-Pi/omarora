> "Focusing on what matters."

### Current Projects
1. **AI for Math Olympiads (AIMO3)**: Working in a team to develop an open-source AI system for solving IMO-level problems and generating verifiable proofs.
2. **Quantative Finance**: Building and backtesting algorithmic trading models under NDA, focusing on high-frequency data and performance optimization.
3. **Theoretical Physics**: Pursuing a multi-phase research program aimed at rigorously formulating a Yang–Mills theory coupled with a Stueckelberg scalar field, with the goal of proving the existence of a mass gap and quark confinement—one of the Clay Institute’s Millennium Problems.
4. **Topological Methods in Finance**: Applying persistent homology to market microstructure data for regime detection and pattern recognition.

### Learning
* Stochastic Calculus & Derivatives Pricing
* Advanced Topological Data Analysis
* Research Writing & Academic Communication
* High-Performance Computing for ML
* Preparing for JEE 2027
* Solving problems for OTIS 25

### Recent Checkpoints
* Attended BeCon 26 at IIT Delhi
* Selected for Dr. Evan Chen’s OTIS 25 advanced Olympiad training program (2025)
* Published two papers in IJRES on extensions to Yang–Mills theory and quantum geometric entanglement.

### Current Focus Areas
* Strengthening my mathematical foundation for quantitative research (measure theory, stochastic processes).
* Building a public portfolio of quant finance projects (where permissible).
* Engaging with academic mentors for guidance on research direction.
* Preparing for JEE 2027, AP coursework, and Mathematics Olympiads while balancing research projects.

### Collaboration
I’m always open to discussing research, quantitative finance, or interdisciplinary projects. If you’re working on something adjacent to AI reasoning, mathematical physics, or algorithmic strategy, feel free to reach out.
