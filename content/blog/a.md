This post tests the $\LaTeX$ rendering capabilities of the site.

## Inline Math
The famous equation is $E=mc^2$. 
We can also talk about $\sum_{i=1}^\infty \frac{1}{i^2} = \frac{\pi^2}{6}$.

## Display Math
Here is the definition of the Fourier Transform:

$$
\hat{f}(\xi) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x) e^{-2\pi i x \xi} \, dx
$$

And a matrix:

$$
A = \begin{pmatrix}
a & b \\
c & d
\end{pmatrix}
$$

If you can see these rendered correctly, then Math support is **active**.
