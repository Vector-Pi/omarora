### **A Weekend That Took Time to Sink In**

### **Arriving at IIT Delhi**

It has been a little over two weeks since I attended BeCon at the [Indian Institute of Technology Delhi](chatgpt://generic-entity?number=0) on 31 January and 1 February 2026, and I find that the experience has stayed with me longer than I expected.

When I first reached campus that Saturday morning, I was mostly curious. I had attended events before and assumed this would be another sequence of talks and panels. But as the day unfolded — walking between venues, overhearing conversations about products, research, funding, and technology — it became clear that this gathering had a different texture. People were not just discussing ideas; they were actively trying to build them.

The event, organized by the [Entrepreneurship Development Cell IIT Delhi](chatgpt://generic-entity?number=1), felt less like a showcase and more like an ecosystem compressed into a weekend.

### **Listening to Builders, Not Just Speakers**

One of the most useful aspects of the weekend was hearing founders speak candidly about process rather than outcomes.

Sessions featuring **[Sanjeev Bikhchandani](chatgpt://generic-entity?number=2)** and **[Ankur Warikoo](chatgpt://generic-entity?number=3)** focused heavily on endurance — the idea that meaningful ventures rarely come from sudden breakthroughs, but from sustained effort over years. That idea resonated with me, especially since research follows a similar rhythm.

The panel with **[Shaily Mehrotra](chatgpt://generic-entity?number=4)** and **[Pratham Mittal](chatgpt://generic-entity?number=5)** emphasized something deceptively simple: clarity of the problem matters more than the elegance of the solution. Whether in startups or theoretical models, precision of framing often determines success.

### **Perspectives Beyond Startups**

Some talks stood out because they widened the scope of discussion.

**[Ashneer Grover](chatgpt://generic-entity?number=6)** spoke with his usual directness about markets and decision-making under uncertainty. **[Nitin Vijay](chatgpt://generic-entity?number=7)** discussed how education must evolve to support innovation rather than merely certify it.

A particularly different perspective came from **[RKS Bhadauria](chatgpt://generic-entity?number=8)**, who spoke about leadership through the lens of defense and technological strategy. His remarks reinforced something I often see in scientific work as well — large-scale outcomes depend as much on institutional structure as on individual brilliance.

### **What Stayed With Me Afterwards**

Looking back now, what stayed with me most was not any single talk, but the environment itself.

Being surrounded by people thinking seriously about building things — whether companies, research labs, or technological platforms — created a sense of momentum. Conversations moved easily between AI, semiconductors, deep-tech startups, and the future of India’s innovation landscape. It reminded me that progress rarely happens in isolation; it accelerates when ideas circulate among people willing to test them.

### **What I Took Away**

I did not return with a startup idea or business plan. Instead, I returned with something more useful:

- A stronger appreciation for long-term execution  
- A reminder that depth of understanding compounds over time  
- And the realization that interdisciplinary work often produces the most interesting directions  

For someone balancing theoretical research, AI systems, and quantitative modeling, the weekend quietly reinforced a principle I already suspected: build foundations first, scale later.

BeCon did not give me answers. But it sharpened several questions I am still thinking about — and for now, that feels like the more valuable outcome.
