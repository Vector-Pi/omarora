### **Arriving at IIT Delhi**

It has been a little over a week since I attended BeCon at the [Indian Institute of Technology Delhi](https://home.iitd.ac.in/) on 31 January and 1 February 2026, and I find that the experience has stayed with me longer than I expected.

When I first reached campus that Saturday morning, I was mostly curious. I had attended similar events before and expected the same thing: a crowd of people in blazers, the same buzzwords echoing off the walls (“disruption,” “scale,” “ecosystem”), and a vague sense of optimism that evaporates the moment you step outside. But as the day unfolded — walking between venues, overhearing conversations about products, research, funding, and technology — it became clear that this gathering had a different texture. This wasn’t just about startups; it felt like the starting blocks of a much bigger, more deliberate race of development.

The event, organized by the [Entrepreneurship Development Cell IIT Delhi](https://www.edciitd.com/main), felt less like a showcase and more like an ecosystem compressed into a weekend. It was a rare opportunity to see the intersection of academic research, entrepreneurial spirit, and real-world impact. 

Kicked off with a inspiring speech by **Shri Devesh Shrivastava**, Special Commissioner of Delhi Police. His speech wasn’t a polite welcome; it was a briefing. He talked about hackathons they’d run, real problems they’d solved with entrepreneurs during COVID, and then laid out a list of what they still desperately need: tamper-proof IMEI tech, smarter traffic systems, AI for hotspot analysis, and more. He wasn’t just asking for innovation; he was giving a procurement list. It set the tone immediately: this was about **building for the state, with the state.** The most interesting problems, it turns out, aren’t always in the consumer app store.

After that, I dove into the **Startup Clinic**. This was the messy, brilliant heart of it all. Tables filled with prototypes, founders with that tired-but-focused look in their eyes. Yes, there were apps with modern solutions for delivery and wellness, but what stopped me were the ones wrestling with physics and chemistry.

I met a team building **Iron-Air batteries**—the kind of tech that could change the energy game if they get it right. Another was deep in **quantum key distribution**. There were **smart textiles** that could do more than just look good, and **antimicrobial walls** for hospitals. These weren't just features; they were fundamental materials science. Chatting with the founders, the passion wasn’t for valuation, but for the problem itself. You could feel the difference.

### **Listening to Builders, Not Just Speakers**

One of the most useful aspects of the weekend was hearing founders speak candidly about process rather than outcomes.

Sessions featuring **[Sanjeev Bikhchandani](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sanjeev-bikhchandani-501261/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_detail_base%3BFgCUZCLPSROJQMv2E3dunw%3D%3D)** and **[Ankur Warikoo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/warikoo/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_detail_base%3BFgCUZCLPSROJQMv2E3dunw%3D%3D)** focused heavily on endurance — the idea that meaningful ventures rarely come from sudden breakthroughs, but from sustained effort over years. That idea resonated with me, especially since research follows a similar rhythm.

The panel with **[Shaily Mehrotra](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shaily-mehrotra-19604966/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_detail_base%3BFgCUZCLPSROJQMv2E3dunw%3D%3D)** and **[Pratham Mittal](https://www.linkedin.com/in/prathammittal/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_detail_base%3BFgCUZCLPSROJQMv2E3dunw%3D%3D)** emphasized something deceptively simple: clarity of the problem matters more than the elegance of the solution. Whether in startups or theoretical models, precision of framing often determines success.

It all wrapped up with the **Grand Moonshot pitches**. The most memorable was **[Aminuteman Technologies](https://aminutemantechnologies.com/)**, working in a critical defense niche. Seeing them pitch was like watching the summit’s entire thesis come to life: an experienced hard-tech team, solving a real-world hard problem, with clear strategic importance.

### **Perspectives Beyond Startups**

Some talks stood out because they widened the scope of discussion.

**[Ashneer Grover](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashneer/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_detail_base%3BFgCUZCLPSROJQMv2E3dunw%3D%3D)** spoke with his usual directness about markets and decision-making under uncertainty. **Nitin Vijay** discussed how education must evolve to support innovation rather than merely certify it.

Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria (Retd.) spoke with a clarity that was almost jarring. He talked about defense needs not as abstract “sectors,” but as specific, urgent gaps. When he mentioned brain drain as a national security risk, you could feel the vibe changing. This wasn’t theory; it was strategy. It made the deep-tech pitches in the clinic suddenly feel not just ambitious, but essential.

### **What Stayed With Me Afterwards**

</div>

Looking back now, what stayed with me most was not any single talk, but the environment itself.

Being surrounded by people thinking seriously about building things — whether companies, research labs, or technological platforms — created a sense of momentum. Conversations moved easily between AI, semiconductors, deep-tech startups, and the future of India’s innovation landscape. It reminded me that progress rarely happens in isolation similar to how research works; it accelerates when ideas circulate among people willing to test them.

### **What I Took Away**

I did not return with a startup idea or business plan. Instead, I returned with something more useful:

- A stronger appreciation for long-term execution  
- A reminder that depth of understanding compounds over time  
- And the realization that interdisciplinary work often produces the most interesting directions  

For someone balancing theoretical research, AI systems, and quantitative modeling, the weekend quietly reinforced a principle which I personally follow: build foundations first, scale later.

BeCon did not give me any answers. But it sharpened several questions I am still thinking about — and for now, that feels like the more valuable outcome.
